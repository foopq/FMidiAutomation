- add recent file queue
    -> on load/save update mru list
    -> add mru list to menu

- for some reason, somtimes entry blocks don't appear in the same order as saved

- sequencer should show entry block properties directly in ui.. hiding/replacing "Selected Keyframe" bits

- cut/copy/paste have context in menu?
    -> don't use set_sensitive directly, but have a function that takes a string for true
    -> perhaps let the paste manager handle it?

- undo/redo needs to consider sequencer/curve editor mode
    - have two undo/redo stacks, delegate based on current mode, update menus when switching modes
    - seperate stacks for sequencer and each entry block's curve editor? -- i think so

- add unit testing
    -> some sort of macro ui recording?

- multiselect keys in curve window + entry blocks --> multi move, delete, etc

- namespace everything

- ensure next / prev tangents are adjusted correctly when adding keyframe (regardless of curve type on any of three)

- ability to reset key tangents (context menu, regular menu? main ui+?)
- ability to lock tangents (context menu, regular menu? main ui+?)

- faint row coloured background per entry block in sequencer
- entry block colour selection
- icon for app (and all dialogs?)


- paste all blocks into selected entry block (ie: to copy to another entry) -- no instance for this

- split / merge entry blocks
    -> entry block multi-select?

- finish record token processing (ie: merging/overwriting entry blocks)

-allow edit of curve in new window --> multiple curves edited at once
    - each has own current / left / right tick pointers as well as the ability to play / loop their own times

- render tangents while also considering the next key, not just the current or previous

- middle mouse click + key command to zoom extents on curve / sequencer

- when moving key, tick value should be set to use nearest tick value, not floor of cur pixel pos
- key/tangent selections/moves
- maintain curve edit parameters when switching between curves
- bezier
- selected entry block should display sampled value when cursor is over an entry block curve
- in curve mode, UI should display sampled value over cursor

- context menu for entry parameters
    - same parameters as larger box plus:
        rpn/nrpn:
        * dropdown with 7/14 bit values or custom to specify min/max values (message on ok if range isn't within 7-bit / 14-bit -- roland likes 14-114)
        * toggle to use rpn/nrpn second byte value (which'll be sent as 0 if disabled -- always a four message sequence)
        * 7 bit values plus use second byte values implies two separate curves (drawn/edited at same time)
        * toggle to start counting at 0 or -half the max value
        * perhaps a dropdown of presets for rpns?

- On sequencer entry delete, box toggle, or reposition we need to request a redraw
- Titles on entry blocks, plus title markup to indicate instance / cutoff
- Add entry curves (and draw such)
    * curves are stored between [0, 1] and scaled by entry min/max values
    * No looping at first
    * Start at cursor
    * Tmp specify length
    * Selection state
    * Move left/right (by click dragging or by context menu -> properties)
    * Handle overlap

- keyboard accelerators
- buttons to set left/right marks off of cursor
- status bar at bottom to indicate errors + fader

- add/delete sequencer entry block in menu and toolbar
??- Entry box label colour theme + set in properties dialog

- recent file menu

~ when resizing window, entry blocks are also resized instead of staying static (need to resize padding block?)
