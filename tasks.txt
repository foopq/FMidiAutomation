- multiselect ops on keyframes
- rubberband selection (sequencer and curve editor)
- faint row coloured background per entry block in sequencer
- entry block colour selection
- icon for app (and all dialogs?)


- paste all blocks into selected entry block (ie: to copy to another entry) -- no instance for this

- split / merge entry blocks
    -> entry block multi-select?

- finish record token processing (ie: merging/overwriting entry blocks)

-allow edit of curve in new window --> multiple curves edited at once
    - each has own current / left / right tick pointers as well as the ability to play / loop their own times

- render tangents while also considering the next key, not just the current or previous

- multiselect keys in curve window --> multi move, delete, etc
    - remove currentlyselectedkey with keyselectiongroup vector

- middle mouse click + key command to zoom extents on curve / sequencer

- when moving key, tick value should be set to use nearest tick value, not floor of cur pixel pos
- key/tangent selections/moves
- maintain curve edit parameters when switching between curves
- bezier
- selected entry block should display sampled value when cursor is over an entry block curve
- in curve mode, UI should display sampled value over cursor


- context menu for entry parameters
    - same parameters as larger box plus:
        rpn/nrpn:
        * dropdown with 7/14 bit values or custom to specify min/max values (message on ok if range isn't within 7-bit / 14-bit -- roland likes 14-114)
        * toggle to use rpn/nrpn second byte value (which'll be sent as 0 if disabled -- always a four message sequence)
        * 7 bit values plus use second byte values implies two separate curves (drawn/edited at same time)
        * toggle to start counting at 0 or -half the max value
        * perhaps a dropdown of presets for rpns?

- On sequencer entry delete, box toggle, or reposition we need to request a redraw
- Titles on entry blocks, plus title markup to indicate instance / cutoff
- Add entry curves (and draw such)
    * curves are stored between [0, 1] and scaled by entry min/max values
    * No looping at first
    * Start at cursor
    * Tmp specify length
    * Selection state
    * Move left/right (by click dragging or by context menu -> properties)
    * Handle overlap

- keyboard accelerators
- buttons to set left/right marks off of cursor
- status bar at bottom to indicate errors + fader

- add/delete sequencer entry block in menu and toolbar
??- Entry box label colour theme + set in properties dialog

- recent file menu

~ when resizing window, entry blocks are also resized instead of staying static (need to resize padding block?)
